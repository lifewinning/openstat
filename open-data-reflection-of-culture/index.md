Motivations for open data
* Transparency, accountability, journalism, &c.
* Making government more efficient
* Business

People want to demonstrate that open data is good, and they do this in whatever
of the above contexts they are used to. Open Data 500 is one example of this for
business. Here are some relevant parts.

* Some pretty fancy people are behind the Open Data 500.
* It's in the GovLab at NYU. That's impressive.
* The Open Data 500 says that huge companies like Amazon use open data. If other
    big people are using open data, it is safe for other companies to use it,
    and it is a good idea for government to support it.
* It's the "first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use open government
    data to generate new business and develop new products and services"

are listed there and why
they need to want a list of businesses that use open data even though everyone
already uses it.

It doesn't really explain what open data is, but maybe that isn't important;
they want to convince people that this nebulous open data buzzword is a good
thing. Maybe these people don't even need to know what open data is. If the
government knows that "open data" is good for business, maybe it will invest in
"open data".










This line is interesting.

> Which of the following are critical sources of data for your company? By “critical,” we mean that your company would have to shut down a line of business, shut down completely, or replace the data in some way if the data were no longer available.
