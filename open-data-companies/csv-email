To: csvsoundsystem@gmail.com


Dear Brian, Jake, Burton, Michael, Thomas, and Cezary,

I hope this e-mail finds you well. I am writing to invite you to submit
Treasury IO for a major study we are doing at The Governance Lab (The
GovLab) <http://thegovlab.org/> at New York University. Open government
data is becoming a powerful national resource to foster innovation, spur
economic growth, and support new solutions for the public good.

*We hope that you will submit Treasury IO for the Open Data 500
<http://thegovlab.org/about-the-open-data-500/>, the first comprehensive
study of U.S. companies that use open government data, funded by the Knight
Foundation <http://www.knightfoundation.org/>.* Our goal is to understand
how companies use open government data, how it can be more useful, and how
it promotes innovation. Our list currently includes companies in health,
financial, energy, education, and other government data, as well as
companies providing platforms, analytics, or other services to make
government data more accessible and valuable. We believe that aspects of
your company's work meet this criteria.

We hope that the Open Data 500 will spotlight many of the most important
companies in this field and will foster new, productive conversations
between government and business about the best uses of open government data.

To qualify for the Open Data 500, a company must:

   - Be U.S.-based
   - Earn revenue from its products and services, and
   - Use open government data as a key resource for its business. (*While
   most Open Data 500 companies use federal data, we are also interested in
   those that use city or state data if their work scales regionally or
   nationally.*)

*Please fill out this short survey
<http://thegovlab.org/submit-your-company/> if you believe that your
company meets our criteria and would like to be considered for the Open
Data 500.* To ensure that we have time to consider your submission, please
complete the survey by *Friday, December 13th*.

If you have comments or questions or would like to tell us about other
companies using open government data, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks in advance for your help with this project.

Best,
Marilla

I don't get it... We aren't a company making money from knight data. We're more a data source that other companies would use to get data funded by knight.
